## ABOUT

Postpartum depression and anxiety affect 1 in 6 new mothers and, without regular monitoring, many of the symptoms often go unnoticed until it becomes severe. Mothers don't often seek help due to factors like cost, lack of awareness, limited access to the healthcare system, and stigma associated with it.
